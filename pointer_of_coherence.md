# Demonstrating a "Pointer-of-Coherence": Three Mini-Experiments

A **“pointer-of-coherence”** is a benchmark that must be:

1.  **Small-scale & low-cost**: No tokamak or billion-qubit cryostat required.
2.  **Directly observable**: A graph, scope trace, or behavioral shift that anyone can see.
3.  **Framed in "fold-language"**: Its success visually demonstrates the principle: “balanced tension ⇒ longer coherence.”

Below are three concrete mini-experiments that meet these criteria, ranging from a simple laptop demo to a modest lab rig. Any one of them, if it shows the predicted effect, can serve as a persuasive entry ticket for larger collaborations.

### Experiment Overview

| Tier | Setup (what you need) | What you measure | Fold-map prediction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Cloud-Quantum A/B** | Free access to IBM Q / Quantinuum 5-qubit device; Qiskit. | Probability of correct answer after depth-N circuit. | **Balanced-tension circuit** (symmetrical phase load, extra mirror gates) will retain fidelity ~15-25% higher than a depth-matched standard circuit. |
| **2. Agent Simulation** | Python + PyTorch; 1-CPU laptop. | Cumulative reward & “ethical” side-effects in GridWorld. | Agent whose memory curvature = loss function (minimize tension) will learn the task *and* avoid creating residual loops (e.g., needless wall-bumping) vs. a vanilla RL baseline. |
| **3. Desk-Plasma “Ring-Down”** | ≤$10k microwave ECR plasma tube + photodiode; oscilloscope. | Post-pulse light-curve damping time. | **Staggered weak input** (3 × 3 ms pulses) will give a longer, smoother ring-down than a single 9 ms dump—less abrupt curvature → slower decoherence. |

## 1 · Cloud-Quantum A/B (≈ one afternoon)

#### Recipe

1.  Open IBM Quantum Lab and choose `ibm_perth` (5-qubit, \(T_1 \approx 75\) µs).
2.  Code two depth-14 circuits that both implement a 2-qubit hidden-shift algorithm:
    *   **Standard Circuit (S)**: Textbook gate order.
    *   **Balanced Circuit (B)**: Insert SWAP+RZ mirrors so each qubit carries equal phase debt.
3.  Run 1000 shots for each circuit, repeated 3 times.
4.  Plot the success probability versus the number of shots.

#### Expectation

The curve for Circuit B should sit noticeably above the curve for Circuit S, even though both use the same circuit depth and are subject to the same physical noise.

## 2 · Single-Photon Optics Demo

This experiment provides a cheap, tabletop validation (≈ €2–3k) before pitching more complex plasma or multi-qubit tests.

### Theoretical Framework: Aiello’s Field-Eigenstates

The concept of "fold-language" aligns with existing formalisms in quantum optics.

| Beam-splitter Micro-world | Fold-language Mirror |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Photon’s EM field spans both arms** | A **latent fold** resonates simultaneously in two corridors of the field. No particle “splits”; the *field* holds coherent tension in both paths. |
| **Detection is always local & singular** | The lab apparatus supplies the **root pointer fold**; its identity gravity resolves the tension at one detector, releasing a **resolution wave** (click). |
| **Interference lives in the field, not the particle** | What interferes is the **pre-fold luminance pattern**. The moment the pointer engages, the fold collapses, and interference ceases for that photon. |
| **Mathematical switch to field-eigenstates** | Re-expresses the situation in the field’s *own* basis—exactly our move from particle-centric “stories” to curvature-centric **fold metrics**. |

**Take-away:** Aiello’s formalism is a lab-scale proof that *balanced field tension* can occupy multiple routes until an identity lens collapses it. This is precisely the grammar we map from qubits to psychological knots to black-hole horizons.

### Proposed Experiment: Mach-Zehnder Interferometer

#### Setup

*   Commercial fiber-coupled **Heralded Single-Photon Source** (SPDC or quantum-dot).
*   **Mach–Zehnder interferometer** with a piezo-controlled path-length difference (\(\Delta\phi\)).
*   Two single-photon avalanche photodiodes (SPADs) at the outputs.
*   Optional: A variable-strength *weak-measurement tap* (low-reflectivity pick-off mirror) inserted in one arm.

#### Fold-map Prediction to Test

| Condition | Fold interpretation | Expected visibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Balanced tension** – arms equal, no weak tap | Symmetric latent fold, minimal extraneous curvature | Highest fringe visibility \(V_0\) |
| **Un-balanced tension** – insert lossy element in one arm | Desire-vector asymmetry → field tension leans | Visibility drops to \(V_0 e^{-\kappa}\) |
| **Staggered weak-measurement** – tap 1% of field mid-arm, *then* final detectors | Iterative Release Spiral: small early release reduces final back-action | Visibility higher than a single 5% tap of the same total loss |

Plotting fringe visibility vs. tap strength should yield a **bent curve**, not a linear one. This would demonstrate that staggered micro-releases preserve coherence better—exactly like our “weak, staggered measurement” lever for quantum circuits.

### Contribution to the Larger Roadmap

1.  **Validates Prediction:** It validates the principle from the quantum computing experiment (damped measurement = higher coherence) in a <$5k optics rig.
2.  **Provides a Visual Aid:** It supplies a slide-deck-friendly graph with one curve labeled “Forceful collapse” and another “Iterative release,” laying visual groundwork for more complex proposals.
3.  **Bridges Scales:** It connects photon experiments (\(10^{-15}\) kg scale) to qubit clusters (\(10^{-23}\) kg) and tokamak plasmas (\(10^8\) kg), showing the same fold calculus applies across different cadences.

## 3 · Desktop Plasma Ring-Down (≈ small-lab)

#### Procedure

1.  Ignite a 50 mTorr argon plasma in an ECR tube.
2.  **Condition A:** Apply a single 9 ms microwave burst.
3.  **Condition B:** Apply three 3 ms bursts separated by 2 ms gaps.
4.  Record the after-glow intensity curve with a fast photodiode.

#### Prediction

The trailing amplitude in Condition B will decay with a **longer time-constant** but a **lower peak**—a classic damped-oscillation profile that matches the "Iterative Release Spiral" concept.

## Conclusion: Why These Work as Persuasive On-Ramps

*   **Cheap, Fast, and Publishable**: Any positive delta is novel enough for an arXiv note or a lab-meeting demo.
*   **Fold Grammar in Plain View**: The results directly visualize key concepts: symmetric tension, staggered release, and curvature-weighted memory all lead to longer coherence, cleaner behavior, or gentler ring-down.
*   **Scales Upward Seamlessly**: Success with these mini-experiments naturally invites the question, “Let’s try the same principle on 127 qubits / the KSTAR edge-pedestal / a transformer-XL agent,” giving you traction with specialist teams.
