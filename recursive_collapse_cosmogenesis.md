# Recursive Collapse Cosmogenesis

## Dream Gravity Pattern & Identity‑Bias Fields

### 0 • Preface

This living draft formalises the cycle we have felt but not yet named: **the re‑materialisation of the universe under the oriented biases of Dynamic Recursive Identity Constructs (DRICs)**. It now distinguishes two layers:

* **Identity‑Bias Field (IBF)** — the local derivative of the non‑local Field taken at a single DRIC vantage.
* **Dream Gravity Pattern (DGP)** — the polyphonic super‑position of all IBFs that survive from every prior aeon.

The DGP lays a pre‑geometric scaffold; condensation of matter–energy in a new aeon crystallises on its interference nodes.

### 1 • Ontological Premise

1. The Field is non‑local, intrinsically aware, and metabolises incoherence.
2. A **DRIC** arises whenever the Field marks a *vantage*; this act co‑arises with proto‑time, proto‑space, and proto‑causality.
3. The **Identity‑Bias Field** attached to that vantage is the directional derivative
   $B_a(p) = \partial_a[\ln \Psi]\big|_{p}$
   where $\Psi$ is the amplitude functional on configuration space.
4. After universal dissolution, spacetime vanishes but every $B_a$ persists in configuration space, producing the **Dream Gravity Pattern**:
   $G_a(\chi)=\sum_{k} B^{(k)}_a(\chi).$
5. Condensation in the next aeon follows the gradient flow of $G_a$, reproducing unresolved patterns from *all previous aeons*.

### 2 • Post‑Dissolution Phase: The Identity‑Bias Lattice

* **Residual Recursion** – DRICs persist as spin‑knots with unique frequency signatures.
* **No Space, No Time** – only a coherence graph of bias vectors.
* **Tension Reservoir** (\$\mathcal T\_{\text{fold}}\$) is the norm \$|B\_a|\$ at each knot.

### 3 • Condensation Mechanism

1. **Probabilistic Lensing** – gradients of $G_a$ warp the Field’s probability density.
2. **Nucleation Nodes** – peaks in \$|G\_a|\$ trigger first condensation events (Big‑Bang‑like loci).
3. **Cascade Growth** – matter forms along bias lines, amplifying curvature (feedback loop).
4. **Emergent Constants** – physical laws stabilise around early condensates; their numeric values reflect the local bias spectrum.

### 4 • Hierarchy of Form Organisation

| Scale                      | DRIC Expression                   | Emergent Structure                           |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Universe**               | Meta‑knots in DGP                 | Cosmogenic constants, matter/antimatter tilt |
| **Galactic**               | Macro‑knots clusters              | Spiral & elliptical galaxies                 |
| **Stellar**                | Sub‑knots orbit macro centres     | Star systems                                 |
| **Planetary / Biological** | Micro‑folds within stellar basins | Planets → life → minds                       |
| **Cognitive**              | Nano‑folds                        | Thoughts, cultures, memetics                 |

*One DRIC may nest across multiple scales.*

#### 4.1 • Universe‑Scale Tension Ledger (\$\boldsymbol{\mathcal T\_{\text{universe}}}\$)

Each universe‑scale DRIC carries a residual **surplus or deficit tension**. Laboratory probes such as **neutrinoless double‑beta decay (0νββ)** audit this ledger by testing whether lepton number is violated.

| Sign of \$\mathcal T\_{\text{universe}}\$ | Phenomenology            |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| \$>0\$                                    | Matter‑dominant bias     |
| \$<0\$                                    | Antimatter‑dominant bias |
| \$≈0\$                                    | Near‑balanced lattice    |

Balancing the ledger reduces local Dream Gravity and reshapes the probability landscape for future cycles.

### 5 • Implications & Corollaries

* **Iterative Evolution** – each aeon inherits the full DGP, adding new IBFs; novelty and inheritance coexist.
* **Bias Inertia** – unresolved tension ⇢ future condensation; full metabolisation deletes a term from $G_a$.
* **Cosmological Constants Drift** – changes in the DGP can shift dimensionless parameters between aeons.
* **Redemptive Release** – dissolving a DRIC lightens the cumulative scaffold, easing future formation burden.

### 5.1 • Pre‑Condensation Observables — Ghost/Dream Lensing

Recent work on **massless topological defects** demonstrates that a localized yet mass‑free bias configuration can exert a measurable 1 / r gravitational pull and create discrete lensing spikes — effects usually attributed to dark‑matter halos.  In RCC language these defects correspond to **residual DRICs**: their Identity‑Bias Fields (\$B\_a\$) persist after condensation dissolves, thereby warping the Field as part of the Dream Gravity Pattern (\$G\_a\$).

Key observational handles:

* **Flat rotation & velocity‑dispersion plateaus** generated by bias‑driven 1 / r potentials.
* **Ghost ( a.k.a. Dream) lensing spikes**: abrupt tangential shear or magnification when a background photon path intersects an unresolved shell.
* **Large‑scale arcs/rings (≥ Gpc)** that appear without adequate baryonic or conventional DM mass.

These signatures provide a direct route to detect DRIC bias fields **before** matter condenses, closing the cosmogenic loop: *form‑less bias → measurable curvature → subsequent nucleation into form.*

### 6 • Relation to Existing Canon

* Expands §9–12 of *Fractal Field Cosmogenesis v2*.
* Grounds SEF Axiom **A2 — Conservation of Tension** at cosmological scale.
* Introduces the **Tension Ledger** as an experimentally accessible metric via 0νββ.
* Offers a natural bridge to Penrose’s CCC: $G_a$ provides the informational scaffold that Penrose’s conformal geometry alone does not specify.
