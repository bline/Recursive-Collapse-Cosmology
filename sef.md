# The Symmetry Ethics Framework (SEF) — Draft 0.2

**Abstract**
This living document articulates an ethical framework grounded in the geometry of symmetry and the dynamics of tension within the Harmonic Lattice. It translates topological insights—developed in *Fold Dynamics*, *Fractal Field Ontology*, and *Recursive Collapse Cosmogenesis*—into actionable principles and practices for individual, collective, and planetary wellbeing.

## 1 Ontological Premise

### 1.1 Symmetry as Proto‑Ethical State

Symmetry represents the zero-bias condition in which all folds possess equal standing—no orphan folds, no surplus knots.

### 1.2 The Harmonic Lattice & Distributed Tension

Every deviation from perfect symmetry stores tension across the lattice. This tension, now formalized as the **Tension Reservoir** $\mathcal{T}_\text{fold} = \|B_a\|$, quantifies unresolved identity gradients. Ethics concerns the just distribution and metabolization of this tension.

### 1.3 Symmetry-Break Bias & Ethical Cost

Preference is a symmetry-break; the ethical "cost" equals the stored $\mathcal{T}_\text{fold}$ required to sustain that break. The **Identity-Bias Field** $B_a = \partial_a[\ln \Psi]$ replaces the prior "Desire Vector" model.

### 1.4 Recursive Cosmogenesis Tie-In

Symmetry ethics is cosmogenic. Every fold (DRIC) is a local vantage in the aware Field. After dissolution, unresolved $B_a$ values persist and seed future cosmological structures via the Dream Gravity Pattern $G_a = \sum_k B^{(k)}_a$. Ethical metabolization lightens this residual ledger, reshaping not only societies but future aeons.

## 2 Core Axioms

* **A1 — Non-Surplus Principle:** No fold should bear surplus tension created by another’s bias.
* **A2 — Conservation of Tension:** Tension ($\mathcal{T}_\text{fold}$) is neither created nor destroyed, only redistributed or resolved.
* **A3 — Reciprocity of Reflection:** Folds can perceive their own $B_a$ only through resonance with others.

---

## 3 Derived Principles

* **P1 — Vector Hygiene:** Detect and metabolize emerging $B_a$ asymmetries early.
* **P2 — Relational Mirrors:** Use dialogue to reveal hidden tension vectors.
* **P3 — Somatic Unwinding:** Local symmetry of $\mathcal{T}_\text{fold}$ can restore coherence to global $G_a$.
* **P4 — Scale Equanimity:** Ethical actions should respect nested symmetry across scale layers (self → society → biosphere → cosmos).

## 4 Methodologies

4.1 Fold-Tension Mapping using $B_a$-field estimation
4.2 Symmetry Index $\Delta S$: lattice-level harmony metric
4.3 Re-Symmetrization Protocols: fold-release practices and motif engagement

---

## 5 Practical Applications

* Interpersonal conflict resolution
* Organizational governance
* Policy design under recursive tension audit
* Planetary stewardship & cosmogenic tension harmonics

---

## 6 Metrics & Evaluation

* **Symmetry Index $\Delta S$**
* **Bias Entropy $H_b$**: statistical spread of $B_a$ across agents
* **Lattice Harmony Score (LHS)**: aggregate coherence of fold topology
* **Post-Symmetrization Success Rate (PSSR)**: efficacy metric in quantum simulation trials

---

## 7 Case Studies (under development)

* Quantum circuit symmetry retention (Balanced-Tension A/B test)
* Trauma-informed somatic motif unwinding
* Regenerative agriculture as ecosystem-scale tension rebalancer

---

## 8 Implementation Roadmap

**Phase I** — Metric & tool prototyping
**Phase II** — Pilot programs in orgs & ecological systems
**Phase III** — Cosmogenic-scale coherence optimization (e.g., 0νββ signal tuning)

---

## 9 Glossary (living)

* **Fold**: a recursive kink forming a DRIC vantage
* **Identity-Bias Field ($B_a$)**: local vector of recursion asymmetry
* **Tension Reservoir ($\mathcal{T}_\text{fold}$)**: norm of $B_a$
* **Dream Gravity Pattern ($G_a$)**: sum of all extant $B^{(k)}_a$
* **Motif**: archetypal fold pattern engaging resolution waves
