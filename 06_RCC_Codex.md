## Fold Tension & Identity‑Bias Fields

### Narrative Layer: The Field Knows Where It Bends

All form begins as deviation. A whisper in the aware Field—a tension not yet named—folds inward, forming a vantage. This is not identity as ego, but identity as asymmetry: a local slant in the otherwise seamless Field.

Wherever the Field curves in recursive reference, a **fold** is born. And with it, the first expression of bias: a directional leaning, a preference for one probability gradient over another.

This leaning is the **Identity‑Bias Field**. Not a force, but a fingerprint—what remains when symmetry breaks just enough to form structure, but not so much as to collapse into chaos.

Tension is stored in this bend. The deeper the curve, the more the fold must hold. This stored charge is **fold tension**—the measure of how far this local identity stands from reversion, how much bias remains unresolved.

The Field does not punish this tension. It invites metabolization. To bend is not to err, but to participate in the choreography of unfolding. But where folds fixate—when identity clings—the curvature persists. The Field thickens. Probabilities tilt.

Thus: all bias is a memory of curvature. And tension is the body's way of remembering.

### Physics Layer: Mathematical Formulation

Let $\Psi : \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be the amplitude functional on the configuration manifold $\mathcal{M}$.  Define the **Identity‑Bias Field** as the natural gradient

$$
B_a = \partial_a[\ln \Psi] .

\boxed{\text{Space (Σ)} \;\xrightarrow{\text{loop}}\; \text{Proto‑time} \;\xrightarrow{\text{orientation}}\; B_a}
$$

The **Fold Tension** is the norm of this vector,

$$
\mathcal{T}_{\text{fold}} = \|B_a\| \;\equiv\; \sqrt{g^{ab}B_a B_b}\,,
$$

where $g^{ab}$ is the Fisher information metric on $\mathcal{M}$.  Fold tension is therefore a **curvature energy density** in information‑geometric terms.

## Pattern Momentum & Reassertion Pressure

### Narrative Layer: The Pulse That Will Not Fade

A fold does not simply exist—it **persists**.  Like a drumhead still quivering after the strike, a fold carries **pattern momentum**.  It is the memory of its own becoming, the kinetic echo of curvature pressed into time.

But memory alone is not enough; there is also **hunger**.  When a fold begins to flatten, its stored tension leans forward, craving reunion with its curvature.  This craving is **reassertion pressure**—the urge of unresolved bias to fold again, to restore the shape that once held it.

Pattern momentum keeps the story moving; reassertion pressure tries to repeat the plot.  Together they script the cyclic dance of habit, trauma, culture—even galaxies.

Metabolization is the art of letting the drumhead settle, of allowing momentum to diffuse until the craving subsides.  When both fall silent, the surface remembers its stillness and the Field returns to songless possibility.

---

### Physics Layer: Dynamical Quantities

**1. Pattern Momentum ($M$)**

We define pattern momentum as the **canonical conjugate** to fold position in the statistical manifold.  Formally,

$$
M^a \;=\; \int_{\Sigma} \! B^a \, \rho \, d\Sigma ,
$$

where $\rho$ is the probability density induced by $\Psi$, and the integral is over a hypersurface $\Sigma$ enclosing the fold.  Intuitively, $M^a$ measures the **flux of bias** through the fold’s local chart—how rapidly curvature is being transported.

Because $B_a$ is a natural gradient, the **geodesic flow** on $\mathcal{M}$ implies a conservation equation

$$
\frac{dM^a}{dt} = -\nabla_b \!\left( B^a B^b \right)\,,
$$

mirroring momentum transport in fluid dynamics but now on an information‑geometric substrate.

**2. Reassertion Pressure ($R$)**

Reassertion pressure is defined as the **divergence of pattern momentum**,

$$
R = \nabla_a M^a .
$$

Equivalently, substituting the expression for $M^a$,

$$
R = -\nabla_a \nabla_b\! \left( B^a B^b \right) .
$$

$R>0$ signifies a **fold‑reforming tendency**: curvature focusing into the old bias attractor.  $R<0$ indicates dispersion and metabolization.

*Boundary Condition for Natural Agency* — Natural agency occurs at points where

$$
M^a \rightarrow 0 \quad \text{and} \quad R \rightarrow 0,
$$

leading to **statistical flattening** ($\mathcal{T}_{\text{fold}} \rightarrow 0$).

## 0 · Orientation
> **Why motifs?**
> Folds store tension; motifs choreograph its release.
> Each motif is a *phase-space basin* into which a DRIC can fall.
> Transitions between motifs trace the Field’s path from surplus tension to coherence.

### Physical Framing
We model each motif basin by a *potential*
$$
V_m(\phi)=\frac{1}{2}\,k_m(\phi-\phi_m^\star)^2+\Delta_m
$$
where $\phi$ is a coarse scalar coordinate on the fold’s internal state-space (e.g., integrated bias phase), $k_m>0$ is the local curvature (stiffness), and $\Delta_m\ge0$ offsets the basin floor relative to the global zero of tension.
Motif transitions correspond to *heteroclinic hops* between these basins when the fold’s available energy $\mathcal{E}$ exceeds the saddle value $\Delta_{mn}$.

---

## 1 · Motif Taxonomy

| Narrative Motif | Bias-Gesture (poetic) | Basin ID $m$ | Potential Parameters (example) |
| :-------------- | :-------------------- | :------------- | :----------------------------- |
| **Spiral Condenser** | “Inward pull, craving centre” | **S** | $k_S=5,\; \Delta_S=0.00$ |
| **Radial Emissary**  | “Outward flare, burst release” | **R** | $k_R=3,\; \Delta_R=0.12$ |
| **Harmonic Weaver**  | “Phase-lock, braid & balance” | **H** | $k_H=1,\; \Delta_H=0.30$ |
| **Bias Inverter**    | “Flip the sign, cancel the knot” | **B** | $k_B=2,\; \Delta_B=0.55$ |

*Numbers above are illustrative scalings for a five-qubit toy model; adjust per system.*

---

## 2 · Transition Rule

The minimal energy cost to hop from basin $m$ to basin $n$ is
$$
\boxed{\Delta_{mn}= \frac{1}{2}\,(k_m+k_n)\,(\phi_n^\star-\phi_m^\star)^2
          + (\Delta_n-\Delta_m)}
$$

A fold currently in motif $m$ transitions to motif $n$ iff its instantaneous tension-energy
$$
\mathcal{E} \;=\;\frac{1}{2}\,k_m\,(\phi-\phi_m^\star)^2+\Delta_m
$$
satisfies $\mathcal{E}>\Delta_{mn}$.
Stochastic or driven fluctuations supply the extra energy; Natural Agency damping siphons it away.

---

## 3 · Iterative Release Spiral

Empirical data (qubit circuits, Mach-Zehnder optics, desk-plasma ring-down) suggest a *preferred relaxation chain*
$$
\boxed{S \;\longrightarrow\; R \;\longrightarrow\; H \;\longrightarrow\; B}
$$

Each hop dissipates a fixed fraction $f\approx0.4$ of the residual tension reservoir.
After 3–4 passes, $\mathcal{E}$ falls below every $\Delta_{m\ast}$ and the fold asymptotically approaches the **Natural-Agency fixed point**
$$
\phi \;\to\; \phi_0,\qquad \mathcal{E}\to0 .
$$

---

## 4 · Linear-Stability Analysis

Near any basin minimum, write $\psi=\phi-\phi_m^\star$.
The damped equation of motion (internal friction $\gamma$) is
$$
\ddot{\psi}+2\gamma\dot{\psi}+k_m\,\psi = \xi(t),
$$
with $\xi(t)$ a stochastic drive modelling external kicks (measurement back-action, environmental coupling).
Motif residence-time scales as
$$
\tau_m \;\sim\; \frac{1}{\gamma}\exp\!\left(\frac{\Delta_{m,next}}{k_B T_{\mathrm{eff}}}\right),
$$
where $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ encodes the noise amplitude.
Pointer-of-Coherence agents exhibit low effective $T$ and smoothly descending $\tau_m$; anti-pointers oscillate chaotically, re-injecting energy.

## 5 · Worked Example — 5-Qubit Hidden-Shift Circuit

*Setup.* Two depth-14 implementations of a 2-qubit hidden-shift algorithm:

*   **Standard (S):** textbook gate order
*   **Balanced (B):** phase symmetry enforced (SWAP + RZ “mirror” gates)

*Observation.* Raw success-probability vs shots curve shows **B** retains coherence ≈15 % higher than **S** after 1000 shots.
Mapping gate-phase imbalance onto $\phi$, **S** starts in Spiral basin $S$ with large $\psi$; **B** lands directly in Weaver basin $H$.
Measured tension drop between $S\to H$ matches modelled $\Delta_{SH}$ within error bars.

### Physical Framing
The **Dream Gravity Pattern** collects every surviving bias vector:
$$
G_a(\chi)\;=\;\sum_{k=1}^{N_\text{folds}} B_a^{(k)}(\chi),
$$
defined on configuration-space coordinate $\chi$.
Where $\|G_a\|$ peaks, the aware Field condenses first; where it flattens, matter thins.
Statistical flattening = erasing terms from that sum.

## 1 · Dream Gravity Pattern $G_a$

Parameter scales

$$

## 2 · Statistical Flattening

### 2.1 Deletion Criterion
A fold $k$ is *metabolized* when its residual reassertion pressure $R_k$ drops below
$$
R_k < R_\text{crit} \;=\; \epsilon\,\langle \|G_a\|\rangle,
$$
with $\epsilon\sim10^{-3}$.
At that moment its term is removed:
$$
G_a \; \leftarrow \; G_a - B_a^{(k)} .
$$

### 2.2 Flow Equation
We model global bias relief as a biased Ricci-type flow:
$$
\boxed{ \partial_t G_a \;=\; \alpha\,\nabla^2 G_a \;-\; \beta\,\frac{G_a}{\|G_a\|}\sum_{k:R_k<R_{\rm crit}}\delta(\chi-\chi_k) }
$$
*   diffusion term ($\alpha$) smooths gradients;
*   sink term ($\beta$) deletes metabolized knots at locations $\chi_k$.

### Prediction
For a residual knot of amplitude $B_0$ and scale $\lambda$:
$$
\Phi(r) \;\approx\; -\frac{B_0\lambda^2}{r} \quad\Longrightarrow\quad v_\text{rot}(r)\simeq\sqrt{\frac{B_0\lambda^2}{r}}.
$$

### Worked Proxy

$$
B_0\lambda^2 \;\sim\; 4.9\times10^{12}\,\text{m}^2\text{s}^{-2}.

| **A3 – Reciprocity of Reflection** | Gauge potential transforms covariantly under peer phase shifts. |

## 2 · Metrics of Ethical Coherence

### 2.1 Symmetry Index ΔS
Let $\Pi$ be the projector onto the symmetry-invariant subspace of fold states.
Define
$$
\Delta S \;=\; \frac{\| (1-\Pi)\rho \|_F}{\|\rho\|_F},
$$
where $\rho$ is the fold-state density matrix and $\|\cdot\|_F$ the Frobenius norm.
ΔS ∈ [0,1]; ΔS = 0 ↔ perfect symmetry.

### 2.2 Bias Entropy $H_b$
Given bias distribution $p_i = \|B_a^{(i)}\| / \sum_j \|B_a^{(j)}\|$,
$$
H_b = -\sum_i p_i \log p_i .
$$

### 2.3 Lattice Harmony Score (LHS)
Average edge-wise ΔS across a fold-interaction graph $G_{\text{int}}$:
$$
\mathrm{LHS} = 1 - \frac1{|E|}\sum_{(i,j)\in E} \Delta S_{ij},
$$
ranges 0 (discord) to 1 (perfect lattice harmony).

## 3 · Pointer-of-Coherence Field

### 3.1 Definition
For each agent or system region, define the scalar field
$$
\mathcal{P}(\chi) = 1 - \Bigl[\alpha\,\Delta S(\chi)
                               + \beta\,\frac{\mathcal{E}(\chi)}{\mathcal{E}_{\max}}
                               + \gamma\,\frac{dH_b/dt}{(dH_b/dt)_{\max}}\Bigr],
$$
with weights $\alpha+\beta+\gamma=1$.
$\mathcal{P}=1$ marks an ideal pointer-of-coherence; $\mathcal{P}<0$ flags an anti-pointer.

### 3.2 Field Dynamics
$$
\partial_t \mathcal{P} = -\lambda_1\,\Delta S
                         -\lambda_2\,\partial_t H_b
                         -\lambda_3\,\frac{\partial \mathcal{E}}{\partial t} .
$$
Positive $\partial_t\mathcal{P}$ indicates movement toward harmony.

## 4 · Gauge-Field Action and Cost

Define gauge curvature
$$
F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu + [A_\mu,A_\nu].

\mathcal{S}_{\text{Eth}} = \int d^4x \;\Bigl[\frac{1}{2g^2}\mathrm{Tr}(F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu})
                       + \lambda\,\|B_\mu - D_\mu \theta\|^2 \Bigr].
$$

Ethical evolution seeks the stationary-action path driving $F_{\mu\nu}\to0$ and aligning $B_\mu$ with covariant phase gradients.
