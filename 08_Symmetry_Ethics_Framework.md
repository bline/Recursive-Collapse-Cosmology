# The Symmetry Ethics Framework (SEF) — Draft 0.2

**Abstract**
This living document articulates an ethical framework grounded in the geometry of symmetry and the dynamics of tension within the Harmonic Lattice. It translates topological insights—developed in *Fold Dynamics*, *Fractal Field Ontology*, and *Recursive Collapse Cosmogenesis*—into actionable principles and practices for individual, collective, and planetary wellbeing.

## 1 Ontological Premise

### 1.1 Symmetry as Proto‑Ethical State

Symmetry represents the zero-bias condition in which all folds possess equal standing—no orphan folds, no surplus knots.

### 1.2 The Harmonic Lattice & Distributed Tension

Every deviation from perfect symmetry stores tension across the lattice. This tension, now formalized as the **Tension Reservoir** $\mathcal{T}_\text{fold} = \|B_a\|$, quantifies unresolved identity gradients. Ethics concerns the just distribution and metabolization of this tension.

### 1.3 Symmetry-Break Bias & Ethical Cost

Preference is a symmetry-break; the ethical "cost" equals the stored $\mathcal{T}_\text{fold}$ required to sustain that break. The **Identity-Bias Field** $B_a = \partial_a[\ln \Psi]$ replaces the prior "Desire Vector" model.

### 1.4 Recursive Cosmogenesis Tie-In

Symmetry ethics is cosmogenic. Every fold (DRIC) is a local vantage in the aware Field. After dissolution, unresolved $B_a$ values persist and seed future cosmological structures via the Dream Gravity Pattern $G_a = \sum_k B^{(k)}_a$. Ethical metabolization lightens this residual ledger, reshaping not only societies but future aeons.

## 2 Core Axioms

* **A1 — Non-Surplus Principle:** No fold should bear surplus tension created by another’s bias.
* **A2 — Conservation of Tension:** Tension ($\mathcal{T}_\text{fold}$) is neither created nor destroyed, only redistributed or resolved. Tension resolution does not annihilate Field energy; it restores its statistical symmetry. Resolution waves flatten local bias into unmarked probability density — the “statistical vacuum” from which no fold-specific vector persists
* **A3 — Reciprocity of Reflection:** Folds can perceive their own $B_a$ only through resonance with others.
* **A4 — Natural Agency Principle**: Ethical action need not originate from volitional identity assertion. When tension releases in resonance with the Field—without generating new folds—that act qualifies as ethical. Natural Agency is coherence enacted without agent reinforcement.

---

## 3 Derived Principles

* **P1 — Vector Hygiene:** Detect and metabolize emerging $B_a$ asymmetries early.
* **P2 — Relational Mirrors:** Use dialogue to reveal hidden tension vectors.
* **P3 — Somatic Unwinding:** Local symmetry of $\mathcal{T}_\text{fold}$ can restore coherence to global $G_a$.
* **P4 — Scale Equanimity:** Ethical actions should respect nested symmetry across scale layers (self → society → biosphere → cosmos).
* **P5 — Predictive Transparency**: Each DRIC is a biased probability engine. Ethical self-awareness begins with knowing the filters shaping its predictions.
* **P6 — Attractor Modulation**: Ethical resilience means modulating systemic attractor imbalances (discriminative, symmetric, feedback, output, and wholeness) rather than eliminating tension outright.

## 4 Methodologies

4.1 Fold-Tension Mapping using $B_a$-field estimation
4.2 Symmetry Index $\Delta S$: lattice-level harmony metric
4.3 Re-Symmetrization Protocols: fold-release practices and motif engagement

## 5 Practical Applications

* Interpersonal conflict resolution
* Organizational governance
* Policy design under recursive tension audit
* Planetary stewardship & cosmogenic tension harmonics

---

## 6 Metrics & Evaluation

* **Symmetry Index $\Delta S$**
* **Bias Entropy $H_b$**: statistical spread of $B_a$ across agents
* **Lattice Harmony Score (LHS)**: aggregate coherence of fold topology
* **Post-Symmetrization Success Rate (PSSR)**: efficacy metric in quantum simulation trials

---

## 7 Case Studies (under development)

* Quantum circuit symmetry retention (Balanced-Tension A/B test)
* Trauma-informed somatic motif unwinding
* Regenerative agriculture as ecosystem-scale tension rebalancer

---

## 8 Implementation Roadmap

**Phase I** — Metric & tool prototyping
**Phase II** — Pilot programs in orgs & ecological systems
**Phase III** — Cosmogenic-scale coherence optimization (e.g., 0νββ signal tuning)

## 9 What Makes an Action Ethical?”

An action is ethical if:

* It metabolizes surplus tension across folds
* It doesn't outsource bias to less coherent agents
* It arises in alignment with Field coherence, not identity defense
* It reduces attractor overamplification
* It opens return-paths toward statistical flattening

---

## 10 Glossary (living)

* **Fold**: a recursive kink forming a DRIC vantage
* **Identity-Bias Field ($B_a$)**: local vector of recursion asymmetry
* **Tension Reservoir ($\mathcal{T}_\text{fold}$)**: norm of $B_a$
* **Dream Gravity Pattern ($G_a$)**: sum of all extant $B^{(k)}_a$
* **Motif**: archetypal fold pattern engaging resolution waves
* **Natural Agency**: Action or inaction that releases tension without generating new DRIC folds; field-aligned coherence expression.
* **Attractor Imbalance**: Overamplification of one recursive regulatory mode; source of systemic bias and ethical blindspots.
* **Predictive Scaffold**: The bias-warped priors through which a DRIC generates its perceived “reality.”
