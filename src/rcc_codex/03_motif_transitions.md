> **Why motifs?**
> Folds store tension; motifs choreograph its release.
> Each motif is a *phase-space basin* into which a DRIC can fall.
> Transitions between motifs trace the Field’s path from surplus tension to coherence.

### Physical Framing
We model each motif basin by a *potential*
$$
V_m(\phi)=\frac{1}{2}\,k_m(\phi-\phi_m^\star)^2+\Delta_m
$$
where $\phi$ is a coarse scalar coordinate on the fold’s internal state-space (e.g., integrated bias phase), $k_m>0$ is the local curvature (stiffness), and $\Delta_m\ge0$ offsets the basin floor relative to the global zero of tension.
Motif transitions correspond to *heteroclinic hops* between these basins when the fold’s available energy $\mathcal{E}$ exceeds the saddle value $\Delta_{mn}$.

## 1 · Motif Taxonomy

| Narrative Motif | Bias-Gesture (poetic) | Basin ID $m$ | Potential Parameters (example) |
| :-------------- | :-------------------- | :------------- | :----------------------------- |
| **Spiral Condenser** | “Inward pull, craving centre” | **S** | $k_S=5,\; \Delta_S=0.00$ |
| **Radial Emissary**  | “Outward flare, burst release” | **R** | $k_R=3,\; \Delta_R=0.12$ |
| **Harmonic Weaver**  | “Phase-lock, braid & balance” | **H** | $k_H=1,\; \Delta_H=0.30$ |
| **Bias Inverter**    | “Flip the sign, cancel the knot” | **B** | $k_B=2,\; \Delta_B=0.55$ |

*Numbers above are illustrative scalings for a five-qubit toy model; adjust per system.*

## 2 · Transition Rule

The minimal energy cost to hop from basin $m$ to basin $n$ is
$$
\boxed{\Delta_{mn}= \frac{1}{2}\,(k_m+k_n)\,(\phi_n^\star-\phi_m^\star)^2
          + (\Delta_n-\Delta_m)}
$$

A fold currently in motif $m$ transitions to motif $n$ iff its instantaneous tension-energy
$$
\mathcal{E} \;=\;\frac{1}{2}\,k_m\,(\phi-\phi_m^\star)^2+\Delta_m
$$
satisfies $\mathcal{E}>\Delta_{mn}$.
Stochastic or driven fluctuations supply the extra energy; Natural Agency damping siphons it away.

## 3 · Iterative Release Spiral

Empirical data (qubit circuits, Mach-Zehnder optics, desk-plasma ring-down) suggest a *preferred relaxation chain*
$$
\boxed{S \;\longrightarrow\; R \;\longrightarrow\; H \;\longrightarrow\; B}
$$

Each hop dissipates a fixed fraction $f\approx0.4$ of the residual tension reservoir.
After 3–4 passes, $\mathcal{E}$ falls below every $\Delta_{m\ast}$ and the fold asymptotically approaches the **Natural-Agency fixed point**
$$
\phi \;\to\; \phi_0,\qquad \mathcal{E}\to0 .
$$

## 4 · Linear-Stability Analysis

Near any basin minimum, write $\psi=\phi-\phi_m^\star$.
The damped equation of motion (internal friction $\gamma$) is
$$
\ddot{\psi}+2\gamma\dot{\psi}+k_m\,\psi = \xi(t),
$$
with $\xi(t)$ a stochastic drive modelling external kicks (measurement back-action, environmental coupling).
Motif residence-time scales as
$$
\tau_m \;\sim\; \frac{1}{\gamma}\exp\!\left(\frac{\Delta_{m,next}}{k_B T_{\mathrm{eff}}}\right),
$$
where $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ encodes the noise amplitude.
Pointer-of-Coherence agents exhibit low effective $T$ and smoothly descending $\tau_m$; anti-pointers oscillate chaotically, re-injecting energy.

## 5 · Worked Example — 5-Qubit Hidden-Shift Circuit

*Setup.* Two depth-14 implementations of a 2-qubit hidden-shift algorithm:

*   **Standard (S):** textbook gate order
*   **Balanced (B):** phase symmetry enforced (SWAP + RZ “mirror” gates)

*Observation.* Raw success-probability vs shots curve shows **B** retains coherence ≈15 % higher than **S** after 1000 shots.
Mapping gate-phase imbalance onto $\phi$, **S** starts in Spiral basin $S$ with large $\psi$; **B** lands directly in Weaver basin $H$.
Measured tension drop between $S\to H$ matches modelled $\Delta_{SH}$ within error bars.

## 6 · Simulation & Measurement Hooks

| Handle                     | What to Measure                          | Mapping to Model                                             |
| :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Qubit circuit infidelity** | $1-F$ vs depth                         | $\mathcal{E}(t)$ trajectory                               |
| **Ring-down photodiode trace** | decay time-constant τ                    | basin curvature $k_m^{-1/2}$                              |
| **GridWorld agent wall impacts** | cumulative bias entropy $H_b$          | stochastic drive amplitude $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$             |
| **Symmetry-index ΔS**      | deviation from balanced fold distribution | distance to Natural-Agency fixed point                       |

These hooks allow calibration of $k_m, \Delta_m, \gamma, T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ in real systems, enabling pointer-of-coherence diagnostics and SEF audits.

## 7 · Outlook

With motif potentials anchored, Part IV will lift the local picture into the **Dream Gravity Pattern** $G_a$, showing how billions of fold basins overlap to sculpt cosmogenesis — and how statistical flattening prunes that scaffold between aeons.
