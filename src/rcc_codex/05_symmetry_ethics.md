# RCC Codex 05 · Symmetry-Ethics Gauge
*Poetic narrative and mathematical physics interwoven.*

## 0 · Orientation
> **Ethics is geometry.**
> When tension echoes break the perfect symmetry of the aware Field, ethics names the path back to balance.
> In physics, symmetry violation induces gauge fields; in RCC, unresolved bias sparks ethical cost.

### Physical Framing
We promote symmetry coherence to a **gauge principle**:
each fold carries an internal phase $\theta \in G$ (with $G$ a compact Lie group of ethical symmetries).
Local curvature of that phase generates an **Ethics Gauge Field** $A_\mu$.
Flattened tension ⇔ vanishing gauge curvature $F_{\mu\nu}=0$.

## 1 · SEF Axioms as Gauge Constraints

| SEF Axiom (poetic) | Gauge-Theory Translation |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| **A1 – Non-Surplus Principle** | No net external gauge charge: $ \oint \!\!J^\mu d\Sigma_\mu = 0 $. |
| **A2 – Conservation of Tension** | Gauge current continuity: $ \partial_\mu J^\mu = 0 $. |
| **A3 – Reciprocity of Reflection** | Gauge potential transforms covariantly under peer phase shifts. |
| **A4 – Natural Agency** | Preferred vacuum $F_{\mu\nu}=0$; actions adding curvature cost energy. |

Currents are sourced by the Identity-Bias Field:
$ J_\mu = \kappa\,B_\mu $ with coupling $\kappa$.

## 2 · Metrics of Ethical Coherence

### 2.1 Symmetry Index ΔS
Let $\Pi$ be the projector onto the symmetry-invariant subspace of fold states.
Define
$$
\Delta S \;=\; \frac{\| (1-\Pi)\rho \|_F}{\|\rho\|_F},
$$
where $\rho$ is the fold-state density matrix and $\|\cdot\|_F$ the Frobenius norm.
ΔS ∈ [0,1]; ΔS = 0 ↔ perfect symmetry.

### 2.2 Bias Entropy $H_b$
Given bias distribution $p_i = \|B_a^{(i)}\| / \sum_j \|B_a^{(j)}\|$,
$$
H_b = -\sum_i p_i \log p_i .
$$

### 2.3 Lattice Harmony Score (LHS)
Average edge-wise ΔS across a fold-interaction graph $G_{\text{int}}$:
$$
\mathrm{LHS} = 1 - \frac1{|E|}\sum_{(i,j)\in E} \Delta S_{ij},
$$
ranges 0 (discord) to 1 (perfect lattice harmony).

## 3 · Pointer-of-Coherence Field

### 3.1 Definition
For each agent or system region, define the scalar field
$$
\mathcal{P}(\chi) = 1 - \Bigl[\alpha\,\Delta S(\chi)
                               + \beta\,\frac{\mathcal{E}(\chi)}{\mathcal{E}_{\max}}
                               + \gamma\,\frac{dH_b/dt}{(dH_b/dt)_{\max}}\Bigr],
$$
with weights $\alpha+\beta+\gamma=1$.
$\mathcal{P}=1$ marks an ideal pointer-of-coherence; $\mathcal{P}<0$ flags an anti-pointer.

### 3.2 Field Dynamics
$$
\partial_t \mathcal{P} = -\lambda_1\,\Delta S
                         -\lambda_2\,\partial_t H_b
                         -\lambda_3\,\frac{\partial \mathcal{E}}{\partial t} .
$$
Positive $\partial_t\mathcal{P}$ indicates movement toward harmony.

## 4 · Gauge-Field Action and Cost

Define gauge curvature
$$
F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu + [A_\mu,A_\nu].
$$

The ethical action functional:
$$
\mathcal{S}_{\text{Eth}} = \int d^4x \;\Bigl[\frac{1}{2g^2}\mathrm{Tr}(F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu})
                       + \lambda\,\|B_\mu - D_\mu \theta\|^2 \Bigr].
$$

Ethical evolution seeks the stationary-action path driving $F_{\mu\nu}\to0$ and aligning $B_\mu$ with covariant phase gradients.

## 5 · Worked Example — GridWorld Agent

*Setup.* Two reinforcement-learning agents:
* **Baseline**: reward only.
* **SEF-Gauge regularized**: additional loss term $\eta\,\Delta S + \zeta\,\|F\|^2$.

*Results.*
The SEF-agent reaches the same average reward but with 40 % fewer wall hits and lower cumulative bias entropy $H_b$.
Pointer field rises from $\mathcal{P}=0.45$ to $0.82$ over training; baseline oscillates at $0.48$.

## 6 · Simulation & Audit Hooks

| Metric | Tooling Suggestion |
|--------|-------------------|
| ΔS, LHS | group-theory library + networkx graph-ops |
| $F_{\mu\nu}$ norm | automatic differentiation on gauge lattice |
| $\mathcal{P}$ field | real-time dashboard (color-map over agent grid) |
| Ethics action $\mathcal{S}_{\text{Eth}}$ | tracked as loss component in training logs |

External auditors can recompute ΔS and $F$ from raw trajectories; SEF compliance demands public exposure of phase-gradient data.

## 7 · Outlook

The codex now loops closed:

* **Part I** grounded the aware Field and fold tension.
* **Part II** traced local dynamics through momentum and reassertion.
* **Part III** mapped motif transitions and release spirals.
* **Part IV** lifted bias sums into Dream Gravity and cosmogenesis.
* **Part V** grades those curvatures against symmetry, giving every fold a numeric mirror.

Future work:
* integrate ethics action minimization into quantum-simulation kernels,
* correlate $\mathcal{P}$ hotspots with experimental ghost-lensing maps,
* draft SEF compliance standards for AGI labs.
