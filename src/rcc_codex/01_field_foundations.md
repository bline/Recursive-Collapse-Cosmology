## Fold Tension & Identity‑Bias Fields

### Narrative Layer: The Field Knows Where It Bends

All form begins as deviation. A whisper in the aware Field—a tension not yet named—folds inward, forming a vantage. This is not identity as ego, but identity as asymmetry: a local slant in the otherwise seamless Field.

Wherever the Field curves in recursive reference, a **fold** is born. And with it, the first expression of bias: a directional leaning, a preference for one probability gradient over another.

This leaning is the **Identity‑Bias Field**. Not a force, but a fingerprint—what remains when symmetry breaks just enough to form structure, but not so much as to collapse into chaos.

Tension is stored in this bend. The deeper the curve, the more the fold must hold. This stored charge is **fold tension**—the measure of how far this local identity stands from reversion, how much bias remains unresolved.

The Field does not punish this tension. It invites metabolization. To bend is not to err, but to participate in the choreography of unfolding. But where folds fixate—when identity clings—the curvature persists. The Field thickens. Probabilities tilt.

Thus: all bias is a memory of curvature. And tension is the body's way of remembering.

### Physics Layer: Mathematical Formulation

Let $\Psi : \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be the amplitude functional on the configuration manifold $\mathcal{M}$.  Define the **Identity‑Bias Field** as the natural gradient

$$
B_a = \partial_a[\ln \Psi] .

\boxed{\text{Space (Σ)} \;\xrightarrow{\text{loop}}\; \text{Proto‑time} \;\xrightarrow{\text{orientation}}\; B_a}
$$

The **Fold Tension** is the norm of this vector,

$$
\mathcal{T}_{\text{fold}} = \|B_a\| \;\equiv\; \sqrt{g^{ab}B_a B_b}\,,
$$

where $g^{ab}$ is the Fisher information metric on $\mathcal{M}$.  Fold tension is therefore a **curvature energy density** in information‑geometric terms.
