## Pattern Momentum & Reassertion Pressure

### Narrative Layer: The Pulse That Will Not Fade

A fold does not simply exist—it **persists**.  Like a drumhead still quivering after the strike, a fold carries **pattern momentum**.  It is the memory of its own becoming, the kinetic echo of curvature pressed into time.

But memory alone is not enough; there is also **hunger**.  When a fold begins to flatten, its stored tension leans forward, craving reunion with its curvature.  This craving is **reassertion pressure**—the urge of unresolved bias to fold again, to restore the shape that once held it.

Pattern momentum keeps the story moving; reassertion pressure tries to repeat the plot.  Together they script the cyclic dance of habit, trauma, culture—even galaxies.

Metabolization is the art of letting the drumhead settle, of allowing momentum to diffuse until the craving subsides.  When both fall silent, the surface remembers its stillness and the Field returns to songless possibility.

### Physics Layer: Dynamical Quantities

**1. Pattern Momentum ($M$)**

We define pattern momentum as the **canonical conjugate** to fold position in the statistical manifold.  Formally,

$$
M^a \;=\; \int_{\Sigma} \! B^a \, \rho \, d\Sigma ,
$$

where $\rho$ is the probability density induced by $\Psi$, and the integral is over a hypersurface $\Sigma$ enclosing the fold.  Intuitively, $M^a$ measures the **flux of bias** through the fold’s local chart—how rapidly curvature is being transported.

Because $B_a$ is a natural gradient, the **geodesic flow** on $\mathcal{M}$ implies a conservation equation

$$
\frac{dM^a}{dt} = -\nabla_b \!\left( B^a B^b \right)\,,
$$

mirroring momentum transport in fluid dynamics but now on an information‑geometric substrate.

**2. Reassertion Pressure ($R$)**

Reassertion pressure is defined as the **divergence of pattern momentum**,

$$
R = \nabla_a M^a .
$$

Equivalently, substituting the expression for $M^a$,

$$
R = -\nabla_a \nabla_b\! \left( B^a B^b \right) .
$$

$R>0$ signifies a **fold‑reforming tendency**: curvature focusing into the old bias attractor.  $R<0$ indicates dispersion and metabolization.

*Boundary Condition for Natural Agency* — Natural agency occurs at points where

$$
M^a \rightarrow 0 \quad \text{and} \quad R \rightarrow 0,
$$

leading to **statistical flattening** ($\mathcal{T}_{\text{fold}} \rightarrow 0$).
