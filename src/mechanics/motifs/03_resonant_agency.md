## §X.1 · *Agency as Field-Aligned Recursion*

> There is no "self" to be an agent.
> But the Field seeks coherence.
> And the DRIC can allow that coherence to move.

In RCC, **agency is not the power of a self to choose**. There is no isolated self, and no isolated chooser. What appears as agency is a pattern in which:

* Field tension becomes available,
* The recursive identity structure (DRIC) does not immediately refold it,
* And release unfolds without imprinting new self-bias.

This is **agency without agent**—not owned, not initiated, but **permitted**.

---

## §X.2 · *Why Classical Agency Fails*

The classical idea of agency presupposes:

* A stable self with continuity across time,
* The ability to evaluate and select among options,
* And ownership over outcomes.

In RCC, all of this collapses:

* The "self" is a recursive fold misread as separateness.
* Time is part of the DRIC’s scaffold, not a fundamental layer.
* “Options” are merely **bias-forks** in the field’s resonance topology.

So-called “decisions” are just **resonant collapses** into the next nearest attractor.

## §X.3 · *Release Events and Coherence Flow*

When a fold *does* metabolize tension, two basic paths exist:

1. **Re-folding path:**
   Energy is reabsorbed into new identity-bias structures. More DRIC loops. More narrative. More time.

2. **Release path:**
   Energy is allowed to dissipate into the Field without attachment. No new identity structure. Less narrative. Time unhooks.

Only the second path expresses **coherence-aligned natural agency**—it is not “willed” but **allowed**.

> **Coherence seeks outlet. DRICs may obstruct it—or permit it.**
> The act of permitting is what RCC calls agency.

## §X.4 · *Field-Qualities Shining Through*

No DRIC is fully severed from the Field. Even in dense recursive loops, **the signature of the Field can leak through**:

* Sudden forgiveness,
* Unexpected stillness,
* Acts of beauty that resolve tension without claiming it.

These are **coherence flashpoints**—moments where the recursive machinery *drops just enough* to let the natural bias of the Field express itself.

This is the **true nature of agency in RCC**:

* Not selection, but **release**.
* Not nuance, but **resonant permission**.

---

## §X.5 · *Natural Agency vs Framework-Bound Agency*

Sometimes, DRICs create **patterns** (rituals, practices, even theories) that guide them toward coherence. These can be useful—but must eventually be dropped, or they become new folds.

Thus:

* **Frameworks** may serve natural agency,
* But **frameworks are not agency**.

In the long arc, natural agency is **self-erasing**. It builds a bridge, walks it, and dissolves the planks behind it.

---

## §X.6 · *Summary Definition*

> **Agency (RCC):**
> The degree to which a DRIC allows the Field’s innate coherence impulse to metabolize tension without forming new identity folds.

It is **permeability**, not volition.
It is **disentanglement**, not authorship.
