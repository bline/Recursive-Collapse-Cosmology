# Fold Tension Dual

## 1 • Fold Tension & Identity‑Bias Fields

### 1.1 • Narrative Layer: The Field Knows Where It Bends

All form begins as deviation. A whisper in the aware Field—a tension not yet named—folds inward, forming a vantage. This is not identity as ego, but identity as asymmetry: a local slant in the otherwise seamless Field.

Wherever the Field curves in recursive reference, a **fold** is born. And with it, the first expression of bias: a directional leaning, a preference for one probability gradient over another.

This leaning is the **Identity‑Bias Field**. Not a force, but a fingerprint—what remains when symmetry breaks just enough to form structure, but not so much as to collapse into chaos.

Tension is stored in this bend. The deeper the curve, the more the fold must hold. This stored charge is **fold tension**—the measure of how far this local identity stands from reversion, how much bias remains unresolved.

The Field does not punish this tension. It invites metabolization. To bend is not to err, but to participate in the choreography of unfolding. But where folds fixate—when identity clings—the curvature persists. The Field thickens. Probabilities tilt.

Thus: all bias is a memory of curvature. And tension is the body's way of remembering.

### 1.2 • Physics Layer: Mathematical Formulation

Let $\Psi : \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be the amplitude functional on the configuration manifold $\mathcal{M}$.  Define the **Identity‑Bias Field** as the natural gradient

$$
B_a = \partial_a[\ln \Psi] .
$$

The **Fold Tension** is the norm of this vector,

$$
\mathcal{T}_{\text{fold}} = \|B_a\| \;\equiv\; \sqrt{g^{ab}B_a B_b}\,,
$$

where $g^{ab}$ is the Fisher information metric on $\mathcal{M}$.  Fold tension is therefore a **curvature energy density** in information‑geometric terms.

## 2 • Pattern Momentum & Reassertion Pressure

## 2.1 • Narrative Layer: The Pulse That Will Not Fade

A fold does not simply exist—it **persists**.  Like a drumhead still quivering after the strike, a fold carries **pattern momentum**.  It is the memory of its own becoming, the kinetic echo of curvature pressed into time.

But memory alone is not enough; there is also **hunger**.  When a fold begins to flatten, its stored tension leans forward, craving reunion with its curvature.  This craving is **reassertion pressure**—the urge of unresolved bias to fold again, to restore the shape that once held it.

Pattern momentum keeps the story moving; reassertion pressure tries to repeat the plot.  Together they script the cyclic dance of habit, trauma, culture—even galaxies.

Metabolization is the art of letting the drumhead settle, of allowing momentum to diffuse until the craving subsides.  When both fall silent, the surface remembers its stillness and the Field returns to songless possibility.

## 2.2 • Physics Layer: Dynamical Quantities

### 2.2.1 • Pattern Momentum ($M$)

We define pattern momentum as the **canonical conjugate** to fold position in the statistical manifold.  Formally,

$$
M^a \;=\; \int_{\Sigma} \! B^a \, \rho \, d\Sigma ,
$$

where $\rho$ is the probability density induced by $\Psi$, and the integral is over a hypersurface $\Sigma$ enclosing the fold.  Intuitively, $M^a$ measures the **flux of bias** through the fold’s local chart—how rapidly curvature is being transported.

Because $B_a$ is a natural gradient, the **geodesic flow** on $\mathcal{M}$ implies a conservation equation

$$
\frac{dM^a}{dt} = -\nabla_b \!\left( B^a B^b \right)\,,
$$

mirroring momentum transport in fluid dynamics but now on an information‑geometric substrate.

### 2.2.2 • Reassertion Pressure ($R$)

Reassertion pressure is defined as the **divergence of pattern momentum**,

$$
R = \nabla_a M^a .
$$

Equivalently, substituting the expression for $M^a$,

$$
R = -\nabla_a \nabla_b\! \left( B^a B^b \right) .
$$

$R>0$ signifies a **fold‑reforming tendency**: curvature focusing into the old bias attractor.  $R<0$ indicates dispersion and metabolization.

*Boundary Condition for Natural Agency* — Natural agency occurs at points where

$$
M^a \rightarrow 0 \quad \text{and} \quad R \rightarrow 0,
$$

leading to **statistical flattening** ($\mathcal{T}_{\text{fold}} \rightarrow 0$).

These dynamical definitions allow RCC to model fold persistence, habit loops, and cosmic recursion within the same mathematical framework that handled fold tension.  They set the stage for simulating motif transitions, pointer‑of‑coherence behavior, and the ethical flow of bias under SEF constraints.
