# RCC Physical Mappings

*A companion reference to Recursive Collapse Cosmology (RCC), connecting ontological primitives to mathematical and physical formalism in quantum theory, information geometry, and statistical mechanics.*

## 0 ‚Ä¢ Purpose

This document bridges the symbolic ontology of RCC‚Äîdefined in `fractal_field_ontology.md`, `recursive_collapse_cosmogenesis.md`, and others‚Äîwith the existing mathematical languages of physics. The aim is to support simulations, cross-disciplinary translation, and further experimental grounding.

## 3 ‚Ä¢ Toward Simulation & Measurement

These mappings suggest pathways to simulate or test RCC principles:

- **Quantum Circuits**: Use circuit symmetry and decoherence profiles to simulate bias tension.
- **Information Geometry**: Map DRIC evolution as flow on statistical manifolds.
- **Phase-space models**: Model motif activation as basin transitions on curvature landscapes.
- **Ethical Indices**: Use group-theoretic symmetry deviation to compute ŒîS, H_b in social agents or networks.

## 4 ‚Ä¢ Forward Hooks

- Formalize DGP as coarse-grained curvature sum ‚Üí Ricci flow interpretation.
- Derive dynamic equations for pattern momentum M and reassertion pressure R.
- Align DRIC motifs with known symmetry groups (U(1), SU(2), etc.) for field-to-particle models.
- Extend pointer-of-coherence experimental suite using quantum optics and plasma diagnostics.
