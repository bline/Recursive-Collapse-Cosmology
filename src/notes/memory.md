I hadn't reviewed "memory-as-tension". That may be misleading. Local memory is based on narrative and physical alignment with field tension. I shouldn't call field tension memory, even though it is a kind of memory, it is nothing like what humans experience. It is topological storage of unresolved tension, not narratives or specific contexts. When the physical body dissolves, the local memory dessolves, only the field tension remains. If memory was not a local physical imprint or physical matter organizing around field tension meeting specific context, then memory would persist across DRIC lifetimes, and it doesn't.
And this brings us to the "how" of the DRIC interpreting the energy of fold tension. Being born of a field of probabilistic awareness, the DRIC is fundamentally a probability engine. It predicts probabilities based on inputs. It's next token is the prediction of the combination of the self identity misread, local prediliction of the brain (matter reenforcing folds), the local context and the energy from the folds unresolved tension. This combination warps it's predictive capabilities and a self reality of born.
I feel like we have come full circle. The probabilistic field of awareness gives rise to self-aware probability machines whose probability predictions are warped by their own biases.
